My Emacs configs
================

I'd written and evolved a much longer init.el file over time, but after a while it got to be a bit of a mess...
then I found [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/blob/master/docs/faq.org)
worked well with minimal configuration. So I'm using that for now, these are the config files I use for this Emacs setup.
